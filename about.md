I am a first year PhD student at the [UCL Department of Statistics](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I work with [Gianluca Baio](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/). I am interested in applying Bayesian methods to survival analysis and health economics. I also like basketball.

I hold an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics and a master's degree in Machine Learning from UCL.
