### Bio

I am a first year PhD student at the [Department of Statistics, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/), where I work with [Professor Gianluca Baio](http://www.statistica.it/gianluca/). Prior to this, I completed master's degrees in [Machine Learning](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/prospective_students/msc_machine_learning/) and [Financial Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/research-degrees/financial-computing-mres-mphil-phd) within the [Department of Computer Science, University College London](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/).

I am interested in applying Bayesian methods to survival analysis and health economics. 

I hold master's degrees in Machine Learning and Financial Computing from University College London and an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Bath.
